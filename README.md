# Chemical Process Fault Detection Using Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network

This repository contains everything needed to reproduce the results presented in the following paper:

> Gilberto M. Xavier and Jos√© Manoel de Seixas. Fault Detection and Diagnosis in a Chemical Process using Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network. 31st International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN 2018. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 8-13 July 2018.

The figure below shows how this new approach (LSTM) outperforms several already published fault detection and diagnosis methods regarding the Fault 3, which is a notable difficult one.
