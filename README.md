# Chemical Process Fault Detection Using Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network

**[27/9/2021 UPDATE] If you are interested in a wrapper for Python, I recommend the one developed by [camaramm](https://github.com/camaramm/tep2py) based on the same modified FORTRAN code used here.**

**[19/8/2021 UPDATE] I've added some chunk of code that allows running the notebook in the Colab environment.**

This repository contains everything needed to reproduce the results presented in the following paper:

> Gilberto M. Xavier and Jos√© Manoel de Seixas. Fault Detection and Diagnosis in a Chemical Process using Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network. 31st International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, IJCNN 2018. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 8-13 July 2018.

Feel free to contribute with this initiative and if you develop derived works based on these codes, please cite the already mentioned paper.

The figure below shows how the new approach (LSTM) presented in this paper outperforms several already published fault detection and diagnosis methods regarding the Fault 3, which is a notable difficult one.
