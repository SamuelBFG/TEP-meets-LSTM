# Chemical Process Fault Detection Using Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network

A novel LSTM-based fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) method was proposed and the simulated Tennessee Eastman process (TE-process) history of only 11 manipulated variables, which includes 6 faults, was used to evaluate its performance against fourteen data-driven FDD methods taken from the literature. Unlike other TE-process data sets with the same faults, the proposed data set represents better the situation faced by engineers in the development of FDD systems, since it is quite unbalanced (i.e. it has fewer abnormal cases compared to the normal ones).

This repository contains everything needed to reproduce the results presented in the following paper:
